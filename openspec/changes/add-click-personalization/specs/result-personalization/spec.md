## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Opt-in click personalization

The system SHALL learn a ranking adjustment from the owner's implicit click feedback only when the
owner has explicitly enabled personalization. It SHALL be off by default, offered as a recommended
step in the first-run wizard and toggleable in Settings. While disabled, the system SHALL NOT record
any engagement signal and SHALL NOT alter ranking.

#### Scenario: Disabled by default

- **WHEN** a fresh profile runs a search and clicks a result
- **THEN** no engagement signal is recorded and result order is unchanged from the base ranking

#### Scenario: Enabled via the wizard or settings

- **WHEN** the owner enables personalization
- **THEN** subsequent owner clicks update the learned model and later searches reflect the bounded
  personalized order

### Requirement: Click-greater-than-skip-above learning signal

The system SHALL, when personalization is enabled and the owner clicks a result at displayed
position p, record a positive observation for the clicked result's host and a negative observation
for each distinct host displayed above position p that was not clicked. Hosts displayed below
position p SHALL be ignored. The same updates SHALL be mirrored per query-term for each query token.

#### Scenario: A click teaches click over skip-above

- **WHEN** the owner clicks the result at position 3 of a displayed list
- **THEN** the host at position 3 gains a click count, the distinct hosts at positions 1 and 2 each
  gain a skip count, and hosts below position 3 are unchanged

### Requirement: Bounded personalized ranking

The system SHALL apply the learned model as a pass between the relevance sort and the user
domain-rule pass. The adjustment SHALL be a bounded multiplicative boost so that engine consensus
remains the primary signal and explicit user pin/raise/lower/block rules always take precedence. The
system SHALL include exploration, cold-start gating, and time decay so personalization cannot
collapse result diversity or act on weak evidence.

#### Scenario: A preferred domain rises within bounds

- **WHEN** the owner has repeatedly clicked a given domain for similar queries
- **THEN** that domain moves up on later searches but by a bounded amount and never above an
  explicitly pinned result

#### Scenario: Cold start does not distort ranking

- **WHEN** too few clicked queries or too few impressions for a domain have accumulated
- **THEN** the base ranking order is returned unchanged

### Requirement: Owner-only training and personalization

The system SHALL train the model and apply personalized ordering only for the owner (the loopback
client and the native app). Network/LAN clients SHALL never train the model, SHALL never receive
personalized ordering, and SHALL have no way to read or influence the learned state. The MCP
agent-safety scope SHALL never be personalized and SHALL record nothing.

#### Scenario: A LAN client cannot influence the model

- **WHEN** a non-loopback client runs searches and clicks results in network mode
- **THEN** the owner's learned model is unchanged and that client's results are not personalized

#### Scenario: Served browser clicks train only via the owner endpoint

- **WHEN** the owner clicks a result on the served page through the owner-only click endpoint
- **THEN** the model updates, and the endpoint redirects only to the server-recorded destination
  for that result so it cannot be used as an open redirect

### Requirement: Encrypted, persistent, portable model

The system SHALL persist the learned model encrypted in the vault so it survives restarts and
updates. When the vault is unavailable or locked (including zero-knowledge mode headlessly),
personalization SHALL be absent without error. The system SHALL let the owner export, import, and
reset the model using a portable JSON format shared with the Android app so the learned state can be
backed up and moved between devices.

#### Scenario: Model survives a restart

- **WHEN** the owner has trained the model and restarts the app
- **THEN** the learned preferences are still applied

#### Scenario: Export and re-import round-trips

- **WHEN** the owner exports the model, resets it, and imports the exported file
- **THEN** the learned preferences are restored and produce the same boosts

#### Scenario: Cross-platform portability

- **WHEN** a model exported by the Android app is imported on the desktop app
- **THEN** it loads and produces identical boosts for the same inputs
